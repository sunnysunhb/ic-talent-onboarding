Vite + React is a modern web development setup that combines Vite, a fast build tool, with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Here's what makes this combination powerful:

### Vite
- Extremely fast development server with hot module replacement (HMR)
- Lightning-quick startup times compared to webpack-based tools
- Native ES modules support for efficient browser loading
- Optimized production builds with automatic code-splitting
- Minimal configuration required to get started

### React
- Component-based UI library for building interactive interfaces
- Virtual DOM for efficient rendering and updates
- Declarative approach to UI development
- Robust ecosystem and community support

### Benefits of Using Vite + React Together
1. Faster development experience than Create React App (CRA)
2. Instant server start and updates
3. Out-of-the-box TypeScript support
4. Easy configuration for CSS, SASS, etc.
5. Optimized production builds
